'I am a computer student and I believe that GitHub makes it easy for me to contact different types of programmers, which is, of course, great for the professional and personal growth I seek. Here below, I passed 'hello world!' into a 'print (value)' function, using the Python language, to display a String."


print(".Hello World!")
print("..Hi!")
